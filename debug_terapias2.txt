OBSERVATION: Navigating to #terapias shows the Resumo Executivo section (01).
This means the page DID scroll but the terapias section is much further down.
The content IS rendering (sections are visible, titles show).
Need to scroll down more to reach the actual terapias section.
The fix worked - sections are no longer hidden by opacity:0 on the parent.
Now need to verify the therapy cards themselves are visible.
