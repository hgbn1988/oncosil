CRITICAL: The smooth scroll JS intercepts ALL anchor clicks and scrolls to the top.
When I click "Terapias" in the nav, the screenshot shows the HERO section, not the terapias section.
The markdown extraction DOES show the terapias content exists (BOT/BAL etc) - so the content IS there.
But the visual viewport shows the hero/landing page area.

The smooth scroll JS must be broken - it's scrolling to the wrong position.
Need to check the smooth scroll event handler.

Also: the hero has a large blank area between the nav and the platform cards.
This is the same "blank space" issue Hugo reported on mobile.
