Verification v3.6 - 20/02/2026

The markdown extraction from the live site confirms ALL content is present in the HTML:

1. NAV BAR: Now includes Equipe link - CONFIRMED (Histórico, Riscos, Desafio, Terapias, Genômico, Roteiro, Equipe, Centros)
2. TERAPIAS section (id="terapias"): Present with "05 — Fronteiras Terapêuticas" heading and therapy cards
3. EQUIPE section (id="equipe"): Now has proper id attribute for navigation
4. All 14 sections render correctly
5. All section/div tags balanced (14/14 sections, 442/442 divs)

The issue Hugo reported was likely:
- The Equipe section was missing id="equipe" so clicking the nav card didn't scroll to it
- The nav bar didn't have an "Equipe" link
- Both are now fixed

Content is all there - the reveal animation (IntersectionObserver) shows elements as you scroll to them.
